# Hey there, I'm Pranav! 👋 

I'm a Statistics, Math, and CS student at Texas A&M passionate about using Data Science and AI/ML to solve real-world problems. 💻

Currently, I'm working on a project to predict delays for Southwest Airlines flights. ✈️

In my free time, I enjoy playing pickleball, fitness, and traveling. Feel free to reach me at [pranavb07@gmail.com](pranavb07@gmail.com)!

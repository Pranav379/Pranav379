# Hey there, I'm Pranav! 👋 

I'm a Statistics, Math, and CS student at Texas A&M passionate about using Data Science and AI/ML to solve real-world problems. 

I'm currently working on a project to predict delays for Southwest Airlines flights using Neural Networks. ✈️

In my free time, I enjoy playing pickleball, fitness, and traveling. Feel free to reach me at [pranavb07@gmail.com](pranavb07@gmail.com)!
